# Getting Started with App
 
 I used postgres and Hasura to connect DB with UI and heroku for deployment.

## Available Features

Here we are providing 2 different interfaces for Drivers and Riders .

Rider can pick a ride and gives the rating to driver.

Driver can give rating to rider once the ride completed.

One can view their own Profile and Ratings
